This is the stable branch


Firmware for Open EVSE: Open Source Hardware J1772 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment
See http://code.google.com/p/open-evse/ for project details.

Compilation help: http://code.google.com/p/open-evse/wiki/LoadingFirmware

NOTES:
- Working versions of the required libraries are included in the libraries/ folder
- Arduino 1.6.x is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for compiling OpenEVSE. Older versions of Arduino will build sketches which are too big to fit into OpenEVSE, unless features are disabled.
